# StudentSurveyNaturalLanguageProcessing
As of 10/16/23 This is my current project
**Repository and File Information**
NLP_Courses.ipynb: The current code base for all Python code regarding cleaning data and model
TestData.csv: Sample Data. Due to FERPA, I can not publish real student data/survey that we will train the model on. To this end, I have used chatGPT to generate data to train my model for this demo.
ReadME.MD: This file :)
.ipynb_checkpoints: Ignore this, these are just some checkpoints for my Jupyter Notebook file
**Project Story**

- Large online courses have surveys that instructors need to manually sort through which may take hours of time, and for certain MOOCs may be borderline impossible
  
- Dr. Mayer, a professor I have researched with and my former Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus professor brought this problem up with me.
  
- To reduce instructor effort in large courses, this project serves to categorize survey responses using machine learning and then automate the appropriate instructor action (send an email with a response to the FAQ) or flag certain responses that require instructor attention.
  
- I am working with Dr. Mayer on this project :)
